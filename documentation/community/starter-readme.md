# Disciple Tools - Plugin Starter Template

__Kick start your Disciple.Tools plugin project with this template!__

__This plugin is a collection of our best practices and code bases for creating Disciple.Tools plugins.__

## Purpose

A team, organization, or movement effort might love Disciple.Tools, but __wish it had one more thing.__

We know that even though we have a common commission to make disciples of all nations, yet our assignments
on how to do that differ greatly or even if we share similar values our stages in movement differ. Either way,
we know we can't create everything everyone needs.

Instead of waiting for us, you can run ahead on your own. This
plugin includes all our best practices and starter codes for the most commonly developed extensions.

We have included starter code for a new post-type, a new REST API endpoint, a new admin page, or a new metrics chart.
The template also provides code quality and code style tools, Travis-CI integration, multi-language support, activation and
deactivation functions, and more. In truth it's likely more than your project needs, so we'll
guide you through removing the elements your project does not need.)

__This plugin is for developers__ who want to extend the Disciple.Tools system for their movement effort.
